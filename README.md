# Banking_System
The objective of the task was to develop a dynamic website centered around a basic banking system. Notably, the website does not include a login page or user creation functionality; rather, it enables the transfer of funds among multiple users.

I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to develop this website, utilizing Visual Studio Code as my Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
